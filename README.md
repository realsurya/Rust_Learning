# Rust_Learning
Documenting my journey learning the awesome Rust programming language!

# Materials
I am following this excellent book:
[The Rust Programming Language](https://www.amazon.com/Rust-Programming-Language-Covers-2018/dp/1718500440/ref=sr_1_4?crid=2LXBBCG2WOMJU&keywords=rust+language&qid=1657903988&sprefix=rust+language%2Caps%2C85&sr=8-4)

# Status
I am **pausing** my learning of the Rust language due to other time commitments and other factors. My rationale for this is:
- I am dissatisfied by Rust's current package ecosystem. It lacks a mature base of packages for GUIs for example.
- Development time seems to be longer due to the added complexities of this language.
- Industry adoption seems low at the moment compared to other languages (such as Go).


Despite this, I do intend to complete learning this language some day. I love Rust because:
- It is very low level, and lacks a garbage collector. This creates very fast programs.
- I can use it to develop OS kernels, embedded software, etc. which is an interest of mine.

I will be reorienting my priority to learn the Go programming language instead. This is because:
- Industry adoption is very high. Especually at my internship, I have noticed how much Go can be daily driven compared to Rust.
- The package ecosystem is more mature than Rust's offerings for my projected applications.
- Go is minimal in syntax and aids fast development.

More to come!
